- Sends welcome emails to all students
- Sends confirmation email to registrar
- Notifies admins of completion

### 4. Template (Complete Redesign)

#### **register.html**
- Radio toggle between single and batch registration
- Two separate form containers (shown/hidden by JavaScript)
- Dynamic student form management:
  - "Add Another Student" button
  - "Remove" button for each student form
  - Real-time student numbering
- **Real-time total calculation**:
  - Updates as students are added/removed
  - Shows: "Total: ₱{amount}"
  - Formula: `student_count × ₱500`
- Responsive design with Bootstrap
- Form validation and error display

### 5. Admin Interface

#### **BatchRegistrationAdmin**
- List view with key information
- Status badges (color-coded)
- Admin actions: Mark as verified/rejected
- Filters and search capabilities

- Creation status (Created/Pending)
- Link to parent batch registration
- Search by student name, email, username

#### **Updated RegistrationPaymentAdmin**
- Shows batch affiliation when applicable
- Badge indicator for batch payments

### 6. Payment Flow Integration

#### **PayMongo Metadata**
```json
{
    "payment_type": "batch_registration",
    "batch_registration_id": "123",
    "number_of_students": 5,
    "registrar_email": "teacher@example.com"
}
```

#### **Webhook Processing**
- Automatic student account creation
- Password hashing and secure storage
- Email notifications (students + registrar)
- Admin notifications

### 7. Management Command

#### **process_batch_registration**

             = Number of Students × ₱500.00
```

The amount is:
- **Displayed** in real-time in the UI
- **Stored** in BatchRegistration.total_amount
- **Sent** to PayMongo as the payment amount
- **Verified** by webhook handler
