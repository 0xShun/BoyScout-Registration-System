## üí≥ NEXT STEPS: Complete the Payment

### Option 1: Using PayMongo TEST Mode (Recommended)

1. **Open the PayMongo Checkout Page:**
   ```
   https://secure-authentication.paymongo.com/sources?id=src_uEUZQCmRJGg8rALTXLxLmfYd
   ```
   *(Already opened in Simple Browser)*

2. **On the PayMongo page:**
   - You'll see payment options: GCash, PayMaya, GrabPay
   - Select **GCash** (or any e-wallet)

3. **For TEST Mode Payment:**
   
   **GCash Test:**
   - You'll see a QR code
   - In TEST mode, PayMongo provides a way to simulate payment
   - Look for a "Pay Now" or "Simulate Payment" button
   - OR use PayMongo's test webhook trigger

   **Alternative - Use PayMongo Dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://dashboard.paymongo.com/
   - Login with your PayMongo account
   - Navigate to: Payments ‚Üí Sources
   - Find source: `src_uEUZQCmRJGg8rALTXLxLmfYd`
   - Click "Mark as Chargeable" or "Test Payment"

## üîî What Happens After Payment

### Automatic Webhook Processing:

1. **PayMongo sends webhook** to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/payments/paymongo/webhook/`
   - Event: `payment.paid`
   - Contains: payment details, metadata

2. **Your server receives webhook:**
   - Finds RegistrationPayment ID: 8
   - Updates status to 'verified'
   - Activates user account (registration_status='active')
   - Sends welcome email
   - Notifies admins

3. **User can login immediately!**

---

## üìä How to Monitor the Test

### Watch Server Logs:

The Django server is running at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

Watch the terminal for logs showing:
```
[INFO] Webhook received: payment.paid
[INFO] Processing payment for RegistrationPayment ID: 8
[INFO] User account activated: testuser_20251017@example.com
```

### Check Database After Payment:

```bash
# Run Django shell
.venv/bin/python manage.py shell

# Check user status
from accounts.models import User, RegistrationPayment
user = User.objects.get(id=33)
print(f"Registration Status: {user.registration_status}")
print(f"Is Active: {user.is_active}")

# Check payment status
payment = RegistrationPayment.objects.get(id=8)
print(f"Payment Status: {payment.status}")
print(f"PayMongo Payment ID: {payment.paymongo_payment_id}")
```

### Check Admin Panel:

1. Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
2. Navigate to: Accounts ‚Üí Registration payments
3. Find RegistrationPayment ID: 8
4. Check if status changed to 'verified'

## üß™ Alternative: Manually Trigger Webhook (for testing)

If you can't complete the payment in TEST mode, you can manually trigger the webhook:

### Create a test webhook payload:

```bash
.venv/bin/python manage.py shell
```

```python
from payments.views import handle_payment_paid
from accounts.models import RegistrationPayment

# Simulate webhook data
webhook_data = {
    'data': {
        'attributes': {
            'type': 'payment.paid',
            'data': {
                'id': 'pay_test123',
                'attributes': {
                    'amount': 50000,  # ‚Ç±500 in centavos
                    'status': 'paid',
                    'source': {
                        'id': 'src_uEUZQCmRJGg8rALTXLxLmfYd'
                    },
                    'metadata': {
                        'user_id': '33',
                        'payment_type': 'registration',
                        'registration_payment_id': '8'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

# Process webhook
handle_payment_paid(webhook_data)

# Verify user activated
user = User.objects.get(id=33)
print(f"User Active: {user.is_active}")
print(f"Registration Status: {user.registration_status}")
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

After payment is completed, verify:

- [ ] RegistrationPayment status = 'verified'
- [ ] RegistrationPayment.paymongo_payment_id is set
- [ ] User.registration_status = 'active'
- [ ] User.is_active = True
- [ ] User can login with: testuser_20251017@example.com / TestPassword123
- [ ] Welcome email sent (check logs if email configured)
- [ ] Admin notification sent

## üéØ Test Single vs Batch Registration

### Current Test: Single Registration ‚úÖ
- 1 user created
- ‚Ç±500.00 payment
- 1 account activated after payment

### To Test Batch Registration:

```bash
.venv/bin/python test_registration_flow.py --type batch
```

This will:
- Create 3 test students
- Generate ‚Ç±1,500 payment (3 √ó ‚Ç±500)
- After payment: 3 accounts created automatically!

---

## üìù Cleanup After Testing

To remove test data:

```bash
.venv/bin/python manage.py shell
```

```python
from accounts.models import User, RegistrationPayment

# Delete test user
User.objects.filter(email='testuser_20251017@example.com').delete()

# Or keep for continued testing
```

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Received?

**Problem:** PayMongo can't reach localhost

**Solution:** Use ngrok to expose localhost:

```bash
# In a new terminal
ngrok http 8000
```

This gives you a public URL like: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`

Update webhook URL in PayMongo dashboard:
- Go to: https://dashboard.paymongo.com/developers/webhooks
- Update URL to: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/payments/paymongo/webhook/`
- Test webhook delivery

### Payment Stuck in Pending?

**For TEST mode:**
- Check PayMongo dashboard
- Manually mark source as "chargeable"
- Or create a payment manually linking to the source
