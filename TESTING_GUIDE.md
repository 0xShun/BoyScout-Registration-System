## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing the PayMongo QR PH payment integration in TEST mode before going to production.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Tools
- [x] Django server running locally
- [x] ngrok installed (`brew install ngrok` or download from https://ngrok.com)
- [x] PayMongo TEST API keys configured in `.env`
- [x] GCash, PayMaya, or GrabPay test account (or real account for test transactions)

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Verify .env has TEST keys
cat .env | grep PAYMONGO
# Should show:
# PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_...
# PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

## üöÄ Phase 1: Local Server Setup

### Step 1: Start Django Server
```bash
cd /home/shun/Documents/boyscout_system
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 manage.py runserver
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Watching for file changes with StatReloader
Performing system checks...

System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
Django version 5.2.7, using settings 'boyscout_system.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

### Step 2: Start ngrok
In a **new terminal**:
```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
ngrok

Region                        Asia Pacific (ap)

print(f"Status: {payment.status}")  # Should be 'verified'
print(f"Payment Method: {payment.payment_method}")  # Should be 'qr_ph'
print(f"PayMongo ID: {payment.paymongo_payment_id}")
```

## üîç Phase 4: Webhook Testing

### Test Case 5: Manual Webhook Test

#### Create Test Webhook Event:
```python
# test_manual_webhook.py
import requests
import json
import os

WEBHOOK_URL = "http://localhost:8000/payments/webhook/"
WEBHOOK_SECRET = os.environ.get('PAYMONGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET')

# Sample payment.paid event
test_event = {
    "data": {
        "id": "evt_test_123",
        "type": "event",
        "attributes": {
            "type": "payment.paid",
            "livemode": False,
            "data": {
                "id": "pay_test_123",
                "type": "payment",
                "attributes": {
                    "amount": 50000,  # ‚Ç±500.00
                    "status": "paid",
                    "source": {
                        "id": "src_test_123"
                    },
                    "metadata": {
                        "user_id": "1",
                        "payment_type": "registration",
                        "registration_payment_id": "1"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

response = requests.post(
    WEBHOOK_URL,
    json=test_event,
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"}
)

print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}")
print(f"Response: {response.text}")
```

Run test:
```bash
python3 test_manual_webhook.py
```

#### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ Status Code: 400 (missing signature - this is correct!)
- ‚úÖ Response contains: "No signature in request"

### Test Case 6: Webhook with Signature (Real PayMongo Event)

This happens automatically when you make a real payment through PayMongo checkout.

**Monitor webhook deliveries:**
1. Go to PayMongo Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Your Webhook
2. Click "Delivery Logs"
3. Check recent deliveries
4. Status should be "Successful" (HTTP 200)

---

## üìä Phase 5: Admin Panel Testing

### Test Case 7: Admin Views Payments

#### Steps:
1. Login to admin: `http://localhost:8000/admin/`
2. Go to **Payments** ‚Üí **Payments**
3. Check list view displays:
   - User (clickable link)
   - Amount (formatted with ‚Ç±)
   - Payment Method (badge)
   - Status (colored badge)
   - PayMongo Status (badge)
   - Date

#### Test Admin Actions:
1. Select multiple pending payments
2. From "Action" dropdown, select "Mark selected as Verified"
3. Click "Go"
4. Verify payments are now verified

#### Test CSV Export:
1. Select some payments
2. From "Action" dropdown, select "Export selected to CSV"
3. Click "Go"
4. CSV file should download

#### Test Payment Details View:
1. Click on a payment ID
2. Verify:
   - All fields display correctly
   - PayMongo section shows source_id, payment_id, gateway_response
   - Receipt image preview (if uploaded)
   - Gateway response formatted as JSON

---

## üé® Phase 6: UI/UX Testing

### Test Case 8: Payment Success Page

#### Steps:
1. Make a payment
2. After completion, verify redirect to success page
3. Check page displays:
   - Success icon (green checkmark)
   - "Payment Processing!" message
   - Information about next steps
   - Loading spinner
   - Auto-redirect countdown
   - Links to payment history and dashboard

### Test Case 9: Payment Failed Page

#### Steps:
1. Start payment but cancel
2. Verify redirect to failed page
3. Check page displays:
   - Failed icon (red X)
   - "Payment Unsuccessful" message
   - Common reasons for failure
   - What to do next
   - "Try Again" button
   - Links to payment history and dashboard

---

## üîí Phase 7: Security Testing

### Test Case 10: Webhook Signature Verification

#### Test Invalid Signature:
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/payments/webhook/",
    json={"test": "data"},
    headers={
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Paymongo-Signature": "invalid_signature"
    }
)

print(f"Status: {response.status_code}")  # Should be 400
print(f"Response: {response.text}")  # Should say "Invalid signature"
```

### Test Case 11: CSRF Protection

Try accessing webhook without proper headers - should be rejected.

---

## üìà Phase 8: Performance Testing

### Test Case 12: Multiple Simultaneous Payments

Create script to simulate multiple users:
```python
import concurrent.futures
import requests

def create_payment(user_id):
    # Simulate payment creation
    pass

with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(create_payment, i) for i in range(10)]
    for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
        print(f"Result: {future.result()}")
```

Monitor:
- Server response times
- Memory usage
- Database connections

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Webhook Not Receiving Events
**Solution:**
1. Verify ngrok is running: `curl https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app`
2. Check PayMongo webhook URL matches ngrok URL
3. Check Django logs for errors
4. Verify webhook secret in `.env` matches PayMongo

### Issue: Payment Not Verifying
**Solution:**
1. Check PayMongo dashboard for transaction status
2. Look for webhook delivery errors
3. Verify signature verification in code
4. Check logs: `tail -f /path/to/django/logs`

### Issue: "No signature in request"
**Solution:** This is expected for manual tests. Real PayMongo webhooks include signature.

### Issue: User Not Activated After Payment
**Solution:**
1. Check webhook was received
2. Verify `handle_payment_paid()` function
3. Check metadata contains correct user_id
4. Look for exceptions in logs
