## 🎯 Next Steps

### Now (Recommended):

1. **Test End-to-End Flow**
   - Create a test payment
   - Complete via PayMongo
   - Verify auto-confirmation works

2. **Check Admin Panel**
   - View payment details
   - See PayMongo transaction IDs
   - Check gateway responses

3. **Test Webhook**
   - Send test event from PayMongo Dashboard
   - Verify Django receives it
   - Check processing logs

### Later (When Ready for Production):

1. **Deploy to Production**
   - Choose hosting (Railway, Render, PythonAnywhere)
   - Get proper domain
   - Install SSL certificate

2. **Switch to LIVE Keys**
   - Get LIVE API keys from PayMongo
   - Update webhook URL to production domain
   - Update `.env` file

3. **Test with Real Money**
   - Start with small amounts
   - Verify everything works
   - Then go live!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Working?

**Check ngrok:**
```bash
# See ngrok status
curl http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels
```

**Check Django logs:**
```bash
# Watch for webhook calls
# In Django terminal, look for:
# "Webhook received: payment.paid"
```

**Verify webhook URL in PayMongo:**
- Must match ngrok URL exactly
- Must be HTTPS
- Must end with `/payments/webhook/`

### Payment Not Auto-Verifying?

1. **Check payment was created:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/admin/payments/payment/
   ```

2. **Check if paymongo_source_id is set:**
   - Should not be empty
   - Starts with `src_`

3. **Check webhook events:**
   - PayMongo Dashboard → Webhooks → Logs
   - Should show events sent

### PayMongo API Errors?

1. **Verify API keys:**
   - Check `.env` file
   - Must be TEST keys (pk_test_, sk_test_)
   - Match keys in PayMongo Dashboard

2. **Check account status:**
   - Some features need verified account
   - Check PayMongo Dashboard for any alerts

## 📊 What to Monitor

### Django Logs
Look for:
```
INFO Webhook received: payment.paid
INFO Payment 123 confirmed as paid
INFO User 456 registration activated
```

### PayMongo Dashboard
Check:
- **Payments** → See all transactions
- **Webhooks** → See webhook delivery status
- **Logs** → See API calls

### Database
Check Payment records:
```bash
.venv/bin/python manage.py shell

from payments.models import Payment
Payment.objects.filter(status='verified').count()
```

## 📞 Quick Commands

```bash
# Start Django
.venv/bin/python manage.py runserver

# Start ngrok (separate terminal)
ngrok http 8000

# Test webhook
.venv/bin/python test_webhook_simple.py

# Check database
.venv/bin/python manage.py dbshell

# View logs
tail -f <your-log-file>

# Access admin
# Open: http://localhost:8000/admin/
```
