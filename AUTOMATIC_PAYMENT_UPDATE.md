# Automatic Payment Update - Complete

## Overview
Successfully updated the ScoutConnect system to use **automatic PayMongo payment ONLY**. Manual payment with receipt upload has been removed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Payment Submission (`payments/`)

#### `payments/forms.py`
- **Removed fields**: `receipt_image`, `payment_method`, `qr_ph_reference`
- **Kept only**: `amount` field
- Simplified form to single field for amount entry

#### `payments/templates/payments/payment_submit.html`
- Removed automatic/manual toggle
- Removed QR code display section
- Simplified UI to show only PayMongo automatic payment
- Shows GCash, PayMaya, GrabPay logos
- Clear instructions for automatic payment flow
- No receipt upload field

#### `payments/views.py` - `payment_submit()`
- Already handles PayMongo integration (from Phase 2)
- Creates PayMongo source automatically
- Redirects to PayMongo checkout URL
- No changes needed (already automatic-only in logic)

### 2. Registration Flow (`accounts/`)

#### `accounts/forms.py` - `UserRegisterForm`
- **Removed field**: `registration_receipt` (no more manual receipt upload)
- **Kept**: `amount` field with help text about automatic payment
- Removed file validation logic for receipts
- Added clear help text: "You'll pay securely via GCash/PayMaya/GrabPay"

#### `accounts/views.py` - `register()`
- **Complete rewrite** to use PayMongo automatic payment
- Flow:
  1. User submits registration form
  2. User account created (status: 'pending')
  3. `RegistrationPayment` record created
  4. PayMongo source created via `PayMongoService`
  5. User redirected to PayMongo checkout URL
  6. After payment, webhook automatically activates account
- **Error handling**: If PayMongo fails, user and payment records are deleted (allows retry)
- **Metadata**: Stores `user_id`, `payment_type='registration'`, `registration_payment_id`

#### `accounts/templates/accounts/register.html`
- **Removed**: Right column with QR code display
- **Removed**: Receipt upload field
- **Changed to**: Single column centered layout
- **Added**: Information box explaining automatic payment
- Shows GCash/PayMaya/GrabPay badges
- Lists benefits: instant verification, secure payment, easy process
- Updated button text: "Register & Proceed to Payment"

### 3. Webhook Handlers (`payments/views.py`)

#### `handle_payment_paid()`
- **Enhanced** to handle both regular payments and registration payments
- Checks `metadata.payment_type` to determine type
- For registration payments:
  - Updates `RegistrationPayment` status to 'verified'
  - Activates user account (`registration_status = 'active'`)
  - Sets `is_active = True`
  - Calculates membership expiry (₱500 = 1 year)
  - Sends confirmation email and notifications
  - Notifies admins of successful registration
- For regular payments:
  - Existing logic (already working from Phase 2)

#### `handle_payment_failed()`
- **Enhanced** to handle both regular payments and registration payments
- For registration payments:
  - Marks `RegistrationPayment` as 'rejected'
  - Sends failure notification to user
  - User can retry registration

## Database Schema

### `RegistrationPayment` Model (No Changes Needed)
Already has the required fields from earlier setup:
- `paymongo_source_id` - PayMongo source ID
- `paymongo_payment_id` - PayMongo payment ID
- `status` - Payment status (pending/verified/rejected)

### `Payment` Model (No Changes Needed)
Already has PayMongo fields from Phase 1:
- `paymongo_source_id`
- `paymongo_payment_id`
- `paymongo_intent_id`
- `payment_method`
- `gateway_response`

## User Flow

### Registration + Payment
1. User visits `/accounts/register/`
2. Fills out registration form (name, email, phone, etc.)
3. Sees registration fee: ₱500 with amount field
4. Clicks "Register & Proceed to Payment"
5. **Backend creates user and PayMongo source**
6. User redirected to PayMongo checkout page
7. User scans QR code with GCash/PayMaya/GrabPay
8. Completes payment in e-wallet app
9. **PayMongo sends webhook to our server**
10. Webhook handler:
    - Verifies payment
    - Activates user account
    - Sets membership expiry
    - Sends confirmation email
11. User can now login and access all features

### Regular Payment Submission
1. User visits `/payments/submit/`
2. Enters payment amount
3. Clicks "Pay with GCash/PayMaya/GrabPay"
4. Redirected to PayMongo checkout
5. Scans QR code and pays
6. Webhook automatically verifies payment
7. Payment status updated to 'verified'

## Benefits

### For Users
✅ **Instant verification** - No waiting for admin approval
✅ **No receipt upload** - No screenshots needed
✅ **Secure payment** - Protected by PayMongo
✅ **Multiple payment options** - GCash, PayMaya, GrabPay
✅ **Immediate access** - Account activated right after payment

### For Admins
✅ **Zero manual verification** - All automatic via webhook
✅ **Real-time notifications** - Informed of all payments
✅ **Accurate tracking** - All payments in PayMongo dashboard
✅ **Reduced workload** - No more receipt checking
✅ **Better audit trail** - Complete payment records from gateway

## Testing

### Test Mode (Current Setup)
- Using PayMongo TEST API keys
- Test payments with test e-wallet accounts
- Webhook receives test events

### Production Deployment
1. Update `.env` with LIVE API keys:
   ```
   PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_live_...
   PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
   PAYMONGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsk_...
   ```
2. Update webhook URL in PayMongo dashboard to production domain
3. Test with small real payment first
4. Monitor logs and PayMongo dashboard

## Important Notes

### Webhook Requirements
- **ngrok** (or similar) needed for local development
- Production must have HTTPS domain
- Webhook signature verification enabled (security)
- Events: `source.chargeable`, `payment.paid`, `payment.failed`

### Error Handling
- If PayMongo fails during registration: user/payment deleted → user can retry
- If payment fails: user notified via email and notification
- All errors logged to console with full traceback

### Migration Notes
- No database migration needed (fields already exist from Phase 1)
- Old manual payments still visible in admin
- New payments all automatic via PayMongo
