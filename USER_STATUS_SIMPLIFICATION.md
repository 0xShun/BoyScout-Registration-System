# User Status Simplification - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Simplified the user registration status system from 6 complex statuses to just 2 clear statuses: **Active** and **Inactive**.

## Changes Made

### 1. User Model (`accounts/models.py`)
**Before:**
```python
REGISTRATION_STATUS_CHOICES = [
    ('pending_payment', 'Pending Registration Payment'),
    ('payment_submitted', 'Registration Payment Submitted'),
    ('partial_payment', 'Partial Registration Payment'),
    ('payment_verified', 'Registration Payment Verified'),
    ('active', 'Active Member'),
    ('inactive', 'Inactive'),
]
```

**After:**
```python
REGISTRATION_STATUS_CHOICES = [
    ('active', 'Active'),
    ('inactive', 'Inactive'),
]
```

**Key Updates:**
- Default status changed from `'pending_payment'` to `'inactive'`
- Updated `is_registration_complete()` property to check for 'active' status
- Simplified `update_registration_status()` method to only set 'active' or 'inactive'
- Admin users are automatically set to 'active' status

### 2. Database Migrations
Created two migrations:

**Migration 0018:** Schema change
- Updated `registration_status` field choices to only 'active' and 'inactive'

**Migration 0019:** Data migration
- Converted all existing users:
  - `payment_verified`, `active` → `active` (with `is_active=True`)
  - `pending_payment`, `payment_submitted`, `partial_payment`, `inactive` → `inactive` (with `is_active=False`)
  - All `admin` users → `active` (with `is_active=True`)

### 3. Registration Flow (`accounts/views.py`)
**New user registration:**
```python
user.rank = 'scout'
user.is_active = False  # Inactive until payment is verified
user.registration_status = 'inactive'  # Will be updated to 'active' after payment
```

### 4. Payment Webhook (`payments/views.py`)
**After successful payment:**
```python
user.registration_status = 'active'
user.is_active = True
```
No changes needed - already sets correct status!

### 5. Login Form Validation (`accounts/forms.py`)
**Updated error message for inactive accounts:**
```python
if not user.is_active:
    raise forms.ValidationError(
        "Your account has been deactivated by the administrator. "
        "Please contact support for assistance."
    )
```

### 6. Admin Interface (`accounts/admin.py`)
**Added admin actions:**
- ✅ **Activate selected users** - Sets `is_active=True` and `registration_status='active'`
- ❌ **Deactivate selected users** - Sets `is_active=False` and `registration_status='inactive'` (except admin users)

**Updated fieldsets:**
- Renamed "Registration Payment" section to "Registration & Status"
- Added `membership_expiry` field for better visibility

### 7. Templates Updated
**Member List (`member_list.html`):**
- Shows "✓ Active Member" (green) or "✗ Inactive" (gray)

**Pending Registrations (`pending_registrations.html`):**
- Shows "✓ Active" (green) or "⏳ Pending Payment" (yellow)

**Verify Registration Payment (`verify_registration_payment.html`):**
- Shows "✓ Active Member" or "✗ Inactive"

**Event Templates:**
- Updated all event templates to check `registration_status == 'active'`
- Simplified conditional logic

## User Flow

### Registration Process:
1. **User registers** → Status: `inactive`, `is_active=False`
2. **User completes PayMongo payment** → Status: `active`, `is_active=True`
3. **User can now login and access all features**

### Admin Management:
1. **Admin deactivates user** → Status: `inactive`, `is_active=False`
2. **User tries to login** → Error: "Your account has been deactivated by the administrator"
3. **Admin reactivates user** → Status: `active`, `is_active=True`
4. **User can login again**

## Status Meanings

| Status | is_active | Description | User Can Login? |
|--------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **active** | `True` | User paid registration fee, account is active | ✅ Yes |
| **inactive** | `False` | Either: (1) Payment pending, or (2) Deactivated by admin | ❌ No |

## Benefits

✅ **Simpler Logic**: Only 2 statuses instead of 6  
✅ **Clearer UI**: Members are either "Active" or "Inactive"  
✅ **Automatic Payment**: PayMongo webhook automatically activates users  
✅ **Admin Control**: Admins can easily activate/deactivate users  
✅ **Better UX**: Clear error message when account is deactivated  

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Register new user → Should be `inactive`
- [ ] Complete PayMongo payment → Should become `active`
- [ ] Active user can login → Should succeed
- [ ] Admin deactivates user → Status changes to `inactive`
- [ ] Deactivated user tries login → Should see "deactivated by administrator" error
- [ ] Admin reactivates user → Status changes to `active`
- [ ] Reactivated user can login → Should succeed
- [ ] Member list shows correct status badges

## Files Modified

### Models & Business Logic:
- `accounts/models.py` - User model and helper methods
- `accounts/views.py` - Registration view
- `accounts/forms.py` - Login form validation
- `accounts/admin.py` - Admin interface with actions
- `payments/views.py` - Verified webhook (already correct)

### Database:
- `accounts/migrations/0018_simplify_registration_status.py` - Schema change
- `accounts/migrations/0019_migrate_registration_status_data.py` - Data migration

### Templates:
- `accounts/templates/accounts/member_list.html`
- `accounts/templates/accounts/pending_registrations.html`
- `accounts/templates/accounts/verify_registration_payment.html`
- `events/templates/events/*.html` (all event templates)

## Notes

- ⚠️ Old status fields (`registration_total_paid`, `registration_amount_required`) are kept for backward compatibility but can be removed in future if not needed
- ✅ Admin users are automatically set to 'active' status and cannot be deactivated
- ✅ All existing data was migrated safely with reversible migration
- ✅ PayMongo automatic payment flow remains unchanged and working

## Next Steps

To test the implementation:

```bash
# Run Django server
python manage.py runserver

# Test scenarios:
# 1. Register a new user at /accounts/register/
# 2. Complete payment via PayMongo
# 3. Login as admin at /admin/
# 4. Go to Users and test activate/deactivate actions
# 5. Try logging in as deactivated user
```
