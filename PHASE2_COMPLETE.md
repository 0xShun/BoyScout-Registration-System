# 🎉 Phase 2 Implementation Complete!

## Summary

Phase 2 of the QR PH and PayMongo integration has been **successfully implemented**! Your ScoutConnect system now supports automatic payment processing via PayMongo.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Webhook Handler (`payments/views.py`)
- **`payment_webhook()`** - Main webhook endpoint
  - Signature verification for security
  - Event routing and processing
  - Error handling and logging

### 2. Webhook Event Handlers
- **`handle_source_chargeable()`** - Payment source ready
- **`handle_payment_paid()`** - Payment successful
  - Auto-verifies payment
  - Updates user registration status
  - Sends email & real-time notifications
  - Calculates membership expiry
- **`handle_payment_failed()`** - Payment failed
  - Marks payment as rejected
  - Notifies user to retry

### 3. Updated Payment Submission (`payment_submit()`)
- Generates QR PH reference numbers
- Creates PayMongo payment sources
- Redirects to PayMongo checkout
- Fallback to manual payment if API fails
- Stores PayMongo transaction IDs

### 4. Success/Failed Redirect Handlers
- **`payment_success()`** - User returns after successful payment
- **`payment_failed()`** - User returns after cancelled/failed payment

### 5. Updated URLs (`payments/urls.py`)
```python
path('webhook/', views.payment_webhook, name='payment_webhook'),
path('success/', views.payment_success, name='payment_success'),
path('failed/', views.payment_failed, name='payment_failed'),
```

### 6. Enhanced Admin Interface (`payments/admin.py`)
- **PaymentAdmin**
  - List view shows: payment_method, qr_ph_reference, status
  - Searchable by: reference number, PayMongo IDs
  - Organized fieldsets for PayMongo integration
  - Read-only PayMongo response fields

- **PaymentQRCodeAdmin**
  - Manage QR codes from admin panel
  - View merchant details
  - Toggle gateway provider

### 7. Updated Payment Template (`payment_submit.html`)
- **Two Payment Modes:**
  - **Automatic** (Default): PayMongo integration
    - Redirects to GCash/PayMaya/GrabPay
    - No receipt upload needed
    - Instant verification
  
  - **Manual**: Traditional receipt upload
    - Shows QR PH code
    - Upload receipt screenshot
    - Manual admin verification

- **Features:**
  - Side-by-side comparison of payment methods
  - Dynamic form fields based on selected mode
  - Clear instructions for each method
  - Help section

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Webhook Flow

```
User scans QR → Pays in e-wallet
         ↓
PayMongo processes payment
         ↓
PayMongo sends webhook to your server
         ↓
Webhook verifies signature (security)
         ↓
Event handler processes payment
         ↓
Database updated + User notified
```

### Security Implementation

1. **Webhook Signature Verification**
   - HMAC SHA-256 signature check
   - Prevents unauthorized webhook calls
   - Constant-time comparison

2. **CSRF Exemption**
   - `@csrf_exempt` on webhook endpoint
   - Required for external POST requests

3. **Error Handling**
   - Try-catch blocks on all handlers
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Graceful degradation

### Payment States

```
pending → [PayMongo creates source]
       → payment_submitted [source.chargeable]
       → verified [payment.paid]
       OR
       → rejected [payment.failed]
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Implementation

### Step 1: Verify Django is Running

```bash
# Check if server is running on port 8000
curl http://localhost:8000/
```

### Step 2: Verify ngrok is Running

```bash
# Your ngrok terminal should show:
Forwarding: https://xxxx.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:8000
```

### Step 3: Test Webhook Endpoint Locally

```bash
# Run the test script
.venv/bin/python test_webhook_locally.py

# Expected output:
# ✅ Response Status: 200
# 🎉 Webhook test successful!
```

### Step 4: Test PayMongo Webhook

In PayMongo Dashboard:
1. Go to **Developers** → **Webhooks**
2. Click your webhook
3. Click **Send test event**
4. Select `payment.paid`
5. Check Django logs for webhook processing

### Step 5: Test Full Payment Flow

1. **Go to payment submission**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/payments/submit/
   ```

2. **Choose Automatic Payment**
   - Enter amount (e.g., 500)
   - Click "Pay with GCash/PayMaya/GrabPay"

3. **You'll be redirected to PayMongo**
   - In TEST mode, you can use test payment credentials
   - Complete the payment

4. **Return to your site**
   - Payment should be automatically verified
   - Check `Payments` list - status should be "Verified"

## 🎯 What Works Now

- ✅ Two payment options (Automatic/Manual)
- ✅ Instant payment with GCash/PayMaya/GrabPay
- ✅ Automatic verification (no waiting)
- ✅ Email + real-time notifications
- ✅ Clear payment instructions

### For Admins:

- ✅ PayMongo transaction tracking
- ✅ Gateway response logging
- ✅ Better admin panel organization
- ✅ Payment method filtering

### Technical:

- ✅ Error logging and recovery
- ✅ Graceful PayMongo API failures
- ✅ Manual payment fallback

## ⚙️ Configuration Check

### Required Environment Variables

Your `.env` file should have:
```bash
# PayMongo TEST Keys (replace with your own)
PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE
PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
PAYMONGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsk_YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_HERE
```

### Webhook Configuration

In PayMongo Dashboard, your webhook should have:
```
URL: https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/payments/webhook/
Events:
  ☑ source.chargeable
  ☑ payment.paid
  ☑ payment.failed
Status: Enabled
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Receiving Events

1. **Check ngrok is running**
   ```bash
   # Should show forwarding URL
   curl http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels
   ```

2. **Check Django logs**
   ```bash
   # Watch Django terminal for webhook calls
   tail -f django.log
   ```

3. **Verify webhook URL in PayMongo**
   - Must match your ngrok URL
   - Must end with `/payments/webhook/`
   - Must be HTTPS (ngrok provides this)

### Payment Not Auto-Verifying

1. **Check payment has source_id**
   ```python
   # In Django admin, check Payment object
   paymongo_source_id should not be empty
   ```

2. **Check webhook events**
   - PayMongo Dashboard → Webhooks → View Logs
   - Should show `payment.paid` events

3. **Check Django logs**
   ```bash
   grep "Webhook received" <your-log-file>
   ```

### PayMongo API Errors

1. **Invalid API keys**
   - Verify keys in `.env` match Dashboard
   - Make sure using TEST keys

2. **Insufficient permissions**
   - Check PayMongo account verification status
   - Some features need verified account

## 📊 What's Next

### Optional Enhancements:

1. **Payment History**
   - Add detailed transaction logs
   - Export payment reports

2. **Refunds**
   - Implement refund workflow
   - Handle `payment.refunded` webhook

3. **Multiple Payment Methods**
   - Add credit/debit card support
   - Add bank transfer option

4. **Recurring Payments**
   - Monthly dues automation
   - Subscription management

5. **Production Deployment**
   - Deploy to hosting service
   - Switch to LIVE API keys
   - Configure proper domain
   - Set up monitoring
